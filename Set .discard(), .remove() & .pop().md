Sure! Let's go step-by-step with a **detailed breakdown** of the problem, the code, and its explanation.

## 🔧 **Problem Statement: Set Commands (`remove`, `discard`, `pop`)**

### ✅ **Objective:**

You are given a **non-empty set** `s` of integers. You will also be given a list of **commands** (`remove`, `discard`, or `pop`) to execute on this set. After performing all the commands, print the **sum of the remaining elements** in the set.

---

## 📘 **Understanding the Set Operations**

Python sets support the following operations:

### `.remove(x)`

* Removes element `x` from the set.
* Raises a `KeyError` if `x` is not found in the set.
* Returns `None`.

### `.discard(x)`

* Removes element `x` from the set.
* **Does not raise** a `KeyError` if `x` is not present.
* Returns `None`.

### `.pop()`

* Removes and **returns a random element** from the set.
* Raises a `KeyError` if the set is **empty**.

---

## 📝 **Input Format**

1. First line: Integer `n` – number of elements in the set.
2. Second line: `n` space-separated non-negative integers – initial elements of the set.
3. Third line: Integer `N` – number of commands.
4. Next `N` lines: Each line is a command – either:

   * `pop`
   * `remove x`
   * `discard x`

## 💡 **Sample Input**

```
9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10
pop
remove 9
discard 9
discard 8
remove 7
pop
discard 6
remove 5
pop
discard 5
```

### After applying all these commands, you must **print the sum** of the remaining elements in the set.

## 🧠 **Explanation of the Code**

```python
n = int(input())                        # Read number of elements
s = set(map(int, input().split()))     # Read the initial set

N = int(input())                       # Read number of commands

for _ in range(N):                     # Loop over each command
    command = input().split()         # Read and split command (e.g., "remove 5" → ['remove', '5'])

    if command[0] == "pop":           # pop has no arguments
        s.pop()

    elif command[0] == "remove":      # remove expects one argument
        try:
            s.remove(int(command[1]))
        except KeyError:
            pass  # avoid crashing if the element isn't in the set

    elif command[0] == "discard":     # discard also expects one argument
        s.discard(int(command[1]))

print(sum(s))                         # Output the sum of elements in the final set
```

---

## 🔍 **Why We Use `try/except` for `remove`?**

* `s.remove(x)` raises a `KeyError` if `x` is not in the set.
* In a competitive programming or exam setting, we **should not allow the program to crash**.
* So, we **handle the error** using a `try/except` block and move on.

---

## 📤 **Output**

The final output is:

```
Sum of the remaining elements in the set
```

This helps evaluate if the operations were executed correctly.

---

## 🧪 **Test Case Demonstration**

**Input:**

```
4
1 2 3 4
3
remove 3
discard 10
pop
```

**Step-by-step Execution:**

* Initial set: `{1, 2, 3, 4}`
* `remove 3` → `{1, 2, 4}`
* `discard 10` → still `{1, 2, 4}`
* `pop()` → removes a random element, say `1` → `{2, 4}`

**Output:** `6` (2 + 4)

---

## ✅ **Conclusion**

This problem tests your understanding of:

* Python set operations
* Basic input parsing
* Exception handling (`KeyError`)
* Set manipulation through commands
