# **Problem Statement**
You are tasked with creating a function that ensures that the first and last names in a given input string are properly capitalized as they would appear on a passport. Specifically:
- For each word in the input string, only the first character should be capitalized, and the remaining characters should stay in lowercase.
- Words containing alphanumeric characters, such as "12abc", should remain unchanged except for the first character of the word, if it is a letter.

#### **Input Format**
- A single string, `S`, containing the full name. The string may contain multiple words separated by spaces.
- Constraints:
  - `0 < len(S) < 1000` (The length of the string must be between 1 and 999 characters.)
  - The string consists of alphanumeric characters and spaces.

#### **Output Format**
- The output should be the input string with each word properly capitalized.

#### **Example**
Input:  
`alison heck`

Output:  
`Alison Heck`

Input:  
`12abc alison`

Output:  
`12abc Alison`

### **Code Explanation**

Below is the Python code to solve this problem, along with its detailed explanation.

```python
#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

# Complete the solve function below.
def solve(s):
    # Step 1: Split the string into words using the .split() method
    # This splits the string wherever there is a space and creates a list of words.
    # Example: "alison heck" -> ['alison', 'heck']
    words = s.split()
    
    # Step 2: Capitalize each word using a list comprehension
    # The capitalize() method only modifies the first character of each word to uppercase
    # and ensures the rest of the characters in the word are lowercase.
    capitalized_words = [word.capitalize() for word in words]
    
    # Step 3: Rejoin the words back into a single string
    # The ' '.join() method combines the list of words into a single string with spaces between them.
    # Example: ['Alison', 'Heck'] -> "Alison Heck"
    result = ' '.join(capitalized_words)
    
    # Step 4: Return the final result
    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Step 5: Open the output file to save the result
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')
    
    # Step 6: Take the input string
    s = input()
    
    # Step 7: Call the solve function and get the result
    result = solve(s)
    
    # Step 8: Write the result to the output file and close the file
    fptr.write(result + '\n')
    fptr.close()
```

### **Detailed Walkthrough**
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The `input()` function takes the userâ€™s input. This is stored in the variable `s`, which is the name to be processed.
   - For example, if `s = "alison heck"`, this input will be passed to the `solve()` function.

2. **Logic to Capitalize Names:**
   - `split()` splits the input string into a list of words. Each word in the string is treated as a separate element of this list. 
   - The list comprehension `[word.capitalize() for word in s.split()]` iterates over each word in the list and applies the `capitalize()` function, which transforms the first character of the word to uppercase while keeping the rest lowercase.

3. **Rejoining Words:**
   - After modifying each word in the list, `join()` is used to combine them into a single string with spaces between the words.

4. **Output:**
   - The final capitalized string is written to the output file or displayed as required.

### **Test Cases**
Here are a few scenarios to ensure the program works as intended:

| **Input**           | **Output**       |
|----------------------|------------------|
| `john doe`          | `John Doe`      |
| `12abc john`        | `12abc John`    |
| `hello world`       | `Hello World`   |
| `JANE DOE`          | `Jane Doe`      |
