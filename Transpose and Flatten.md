# **Detailed Problem Statement**
You are provided with a **2D N x M matrix**, where `N` represents the number of rows, and `M` represents the number of columns. Your task involves two main operations:
1. **Transpose the matrix**: Convert the rows into columns and vice versa.
2. **Flatten the matrix**: Transform the 2D matrix into a 1D array (a single continuous list of elements).

The program should:
- Accept dimensions `N` and `M`.
- Accept the elements of the matrix as input.
- Output the transposed version of the matrix.
- Output the flattened version of the matrix.

# **Explanation of the Code**
Here's a breakdown of the code you provided:

```python
import numpy as np
```
- **Why it's needed**: The `numpy` library provides efficient tools for working with arrays. It allows us to easily transpose and flatten the matrix.

---

```python
# Input N and M
N, M = map(int, input().split())
```
- **What it does**: Reads two integers from the input, separated by a space. These represent the number of rows (`N`) and columns (`M`).
- **Example**: If the input is `2 3`, then `N = 2` (rows) and `M = 3` (columns).

---

```python
# Input the matrix
matrix = []
for _ in range(N):
    row = list(map(int, input().split()))
    matrix.append(row)
```
- **What it does**: Reads the elements of the matrix row by row.
  - The loop runs `N` times (for each row).
  - For each row, it splits the space-separated elements, converts them to integers, and appends the row to the `matrix` list.
- **Example**: If the inputs are:
  ```
  1 2 3
  4 5 6
  ```
  The `matrix` will become:
  ```python
  [[1, 2, 3],
   [4, 5, 6]]
  ```

---

```python
# Convert the matrix to a NumPy array
my_array = np.array(matrix)
```
- **Why it's needed**: NumPy operations require the data to be in the form of a NumPy array. This line converts the 2D list `matrix` into a NumPy array called `my_array`.

---

```python
# Print the transpose of the array
print(np.transpose(my_array))
```
- **What it does**: Generates the transposed version of `my_array`.
  - The `transpose` operation flips rows into columns.
  - For the example matrix `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`, the transpose is:
    ```python
    [[1, 4],
     [2, 5],
     [3, 6]]
    ```
  - **Output**:
    ```
    1 4
    2 5
    3 6
    ```

---

```python
# Print the flatten version of the array
print(my_array.flatten())
```
- **What it does**: Generates a 1D version of the array by collapsing all rows into a single list.
  - For the example matrix `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`, the flattened result is:
    ```python
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    ```
  - **Output**:
    ```
    1 2 3 4 5 6
    ```

---

### **Final Code Explanation**
Hereâ€™s how the code flows:
1. **Input Dimensions**: First, it takes the size of the matrix (N x M) as input.
2. **Input the Matrix**: It reads the matrix row by row and stores it as a 2D list.
3. **Convert to NumPy Array**: The matrix is converted into a NumPy array for easier processing.
4. **Transpose**: Using `numpy.transpose()`, the rows are converted into columns, and the result is printed.
5. **Flatten**: Using `.flatten()`, the matrix is converted into a single 1D array, and the result is printed.

---

### **Sample Input and Output**
#### **Input:**
```
2 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
```

#### **Output:**
```
[[1 4]
 [2 5]
 [3 6]]
[1 2 3 4 5 6]
```
