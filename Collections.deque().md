## **Problem Statement**
You are given a series of operations to perform on an empty double-ended queue (`deque`). The task is to apply the operations sequentially and print the final state of the `deque` in space-separated format.

#### **Input Format**:
1. The first line contains an integer `N`, the number of operations to perform.
2. The next `N` lines contain the names of the operations (`append`, `pop`, `popleft`, or `appendleft`), optionally followed by a value (if applicable).

#### **Output Format**:
- Print the contents of the `deque`, separated by spaces, after performing all the operations.

#### **Constraints**:
- \( 0 < N < 100 \)
- The `deque` starts as empty.

---

### **Code Logic Explanation**
Let's break the code into steps for better understanding:

#### **Step 1: Importing `deque`**
```python
from collections import deque
```
The `deque` (pronounced "deck") is a double-ended queue from Python's `collections` module. It allows **fast appends and pops** from both ends with an approximate \( O(1) \) complexity.

#### **Step 2: Input the Number of Operations**
```python
N = int(input("Enter the number of operations: "))
```
Here, the user inputs the number of operations, `N`, to perform on the `deque`. This ensures we know how many operations to process in a loop.

#### **Step 3: Initialize the Deque**
```python
d = deque()
```
An empty `deque` named `d` is created. All operations (`append`, `pop`, etc.) will be applied to this `deque`.

#### **Step 4: Iterating Through Operations**
```python
for _ in range(N):
    operation = input().split()
    method = operation[0]
```
A `for` loop iterates `N` times. In each iteration:
1. The operation name (e.g., `append`) and an optional value are read from the input.
2. `split()` breaks the input string into parts. For example, `"append 5"` becomes `['append', '5']`.

#### **Step 5: Perform Operations Based on User Input**
```python
if len(operation) > 1:
    value = operation[1]
    if method == "append":
        d.append(value)
    elif method == "appendleft":
        d.appendleft(value)
else:
    if method == "pop":
        d.pop()
    elif method == "popleft":
        d.popleft()
```
- If the input has two parts (`method` and `value`):
  - **`append(value)`**: Adds the value to the right end.
  - **`appendleft(value)`**: Adds the value to the left end.

- If the input is just a single word (`method`):
  - **`pop()`**: Removes and returns the rightmost element.
  - **`popleft()`**: Removes and returns the leftmost element.

#### **Step 6: Print the Final Deque**
```python
print(" ".join(d))
```
At the end of all operations, the contents of the `deque` are joined into a space-separated string (e.g., `"3 7 8 9 6"`) and printed.

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### **Input:**
```
6
append 1
appendleft 2
pop
popleft
append 3
appendleft 4
```

#### **Explanation:**
1. **Start with an empty `deque`:** `deque([])`
2. `append 1`: Add `1` to the right → `deque([1])`
3. `appendleft 2`: Add `2` to the left → `deque([2, 1])`
4. `pop`: Remove from the right → `deque([2])`
5. `popleft`: Remove from the left → `deque([])`
6. `append 3`: Add `3` to the right → `deque([3])`
7. `appendleft 4`: Add `4` to the left → `deque([4, 3])`

#### **Output:**
```
4 3
```

### **What Makes This Code Efficient?**
1. **Fast Operations:** Deques are optimized for operations like `append`, `pop`, and their counterparts for both ends.
2. **Simplicity:** Using a `for` loop and conditional checks ensures the code is concise and easy to follow.
3. **Scalability:** Handles up to 100 operations, adhering to the problem's constraints.
