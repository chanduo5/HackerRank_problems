# Problem Statement
You are given a string \( S \) and an integer \( k \). Your task is to generate and print all possible combinations of size \( k \) from the characters of \( S \) in lexicographically sorted order, allowing for repetition of characters in the combinations.

**Input Format:**
- A single line containing the string \( S \) (all uppercase letters) and the integer \( k \), separated by a space.

**Constraints:**
- \( 0 < k \leq \text{len}(S) \)
- The string \( S \) contains only uppercase English letters.

---

# Code:
Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

# Input
input_line = input("Enter the string and k (separated by space): ")
S, k = input_line.split()
k = int(k)

# Ensure the string is sorted
S = ''.join(sorted(S))

# Generate combinations
result = combinations_with_replacement(S, k)

# Print each combination
for combination in result:
    print(''.join(combination))
```

---

## Detailed Explanation of the Code

#### **1. Importing the Required Library**
```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement
```
- The `itertools` module provides a collection of tools for handling iterators. We use `combinations_with_replacement` here to generate all possible combinations of \( k \) elements, allowing repetition of elements.
- Unlike `combinations`, this function allows the same element to appear more than once in a combination.

---

#### **2. Taking Input**
```python
input_line = input("Enter the string and k (separated by space): ")
S, k = input_line.split()
k = int(k)
```
- The user provides the string \( S \) and the integer \( k \) as input in a single line (e.g., `HACK 2`).
- The string \( S \) is stored in the variable `S`, and `k` is converted to an integer for further calculations.

---

#### **3. Sorting the String**
```python
S = ''.join(sorted(S))
```
- To ensure that the combinations are generated in lexicographically sorted order, the string \( S \) is sorted using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. 
- `sorted(S)` returns a list of sorted characters, and `''.join()` combines them back into a string.

---

#### **4. Generating the Combinations**
```python
result = combinations_with_replacement(S, k)
```
- The function `combinations_with_replacement(S, k)` generates all possible combinations of \( k \) elements from \( S \), allowing each character to be repeated.
- The `result` object is an iterator that produces tuples of characters. Each tuple represents one combination.

---

#### **5. Printing the Combinations**
```python
for combination in result:
    print(''.join(combination))
```
- We iterate through the `result` object, which contains the tuples representing combinations.
- `''.join(combination)` converts each tuple into a string for readability, and we print each combination on a new line.

---

# Example Walkthrough:

#### **Input:**
```
HACK 2
```

#### **Step 1: Sorting the String**
- The string \( S \) is sorted to `ACKH`.

#### **Step 2: Generating Combinations**
- For \( k = 2 \), `combinations_with_replacement` generates these combinations (in tuple form):
  ```
  ('A', 'A'), ('A', 'C'), ('A', 'H'), ('A', 'K'),
  ('C', 'C'), ('C', 'H'), ('C', 'K'),
  ('H', 'H'), ('H', 'K'),
  ('K', 'K')
  ```

#### **Step 3: Printing the Results**
- The tuples are converted to strings and printed:
  ```
  AA
  AC
  AH
  AK
  CC
  CH
  CK
  HH
  HK
  KK
  ```

---

### Key Points to Note:
1. **Lexicographic Order:** Sorting \( S \) ensures the combinations are produced in lexicographic order, as required by the problem.
2. **Repetition:** The `combinations_with_replacement` function inherently allows repeated elements, which is why combinations like `AA` or `CC` are valid.
3. **Tuple to String Conversion:** Each tuple is converted to a string using `''.join()` for a clean and readable output.
