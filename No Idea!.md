Sure! Here's a **complete explanation** of the **problem statement**, **Python code**, and a **line-by-line breakdown** of how the code works.

### ✅ **Problem Statement**

You are given:

* An array of `n` integers.
* Two **disjoint sets**:

  * Set **A**: you **like** the integers in this set.
  * Set **B**: you **dislike** the integers in this set.

Your initial happiness is **0**.
You go through each element in the array and adjust your happiness:

* If an element is in **Set A**, you **add 1** to your happiness.
* If an element is in **Set B**, you **subtract 1** from your happiness.
* If it's in neither, happiness stays the same.

> **Goal:** Calculate and output the final happiness score after processing the entire array.

---

### ✅ **Constraints**

* $1 < n < 10^5$
* $1 \leq m \leq 10^5$
* Elements in A and B are **unique** and **disjoint** (no overlap).
* Array can have **duplicate** values.
* All integers are within the range ±$10^9$.

---

### ✅ **Input Format**

```
Line 1: Two integers n and m — the size of the array and the size of each set
Line 2: n integers — the elements of the array
Line 3: m integers — elements of set A
Line 4: m integers — elements of set B
```

### ✅ **Output Format**

```
A single integer representing your total happiness.
```

---

### ✅ **Sample Input**

```
5 2
1 5 3 3 7
3 7
2 5
```

### ✅ **Sample Output**

```
0
```

**Explanation:**

* Array: \[1, 5, 3, 3, 7]
* Set A: {3, 7} → liked
* Set B: {2, 5} → disliked

Walk through array:

* 1 → not in A or B → happiness = 0
* 5 → in B → happiness = -1
* 3 → in A → happiness = 0
* 3 → in A → happiness = 1
* 7 → in A → happiness = 2

**Final happiness = 2 (from A) - 1 (from B) = 1**

(Sorry, in this example the output should actually be **1**, not **0** as in the earlier answer.)

### ✅ **Python Code**

```python
# Read input
n, m = map(int, input().split())  # First line: n and m
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Second line: the array of n integers
A = set(map(int, input().split()))  # Third line: set A with m liked integers
B = set(map(int, input().split()))  # Fourth line: set B with m disliked integers

# Initialize happiness
happiness = 0

# Calculate happiness
for num in arr:
    if num in A:
        happiness += 1
    elif num in B:
        happiness -= 1

# Output result
print(happiness)
```

---

### ✅ **Line-by-Line Explanation**

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
```

* Reads the first line with two integers:
  `n` = number of array elements,
  `m` = number of elements in sets A and B.

```python
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

* Reads the array of `n` integers.

```python
A = set(map(int, input().split()))
```

* Reads the liked integers and stores them in set `A` for fast lookup (`O(1)` average time).

```python
B = set(map(int, input().split()))
```

* Reads the disliked integers and stores them in set `B`.

```python
happiness = 0
```

* Initializes your happiness to 0.

```python
for num in arr:
```

* Iterates over each element `num` in the array.

```python
    if num in A:
        happiness += 1
```

* If the number is in `A`, add 1 to happiness.

```python
    elif num in B:
        happiness -= 1
```

* If the number is in `B`, subtract 1 from happiness.

```python
print(happiness)
```

* Prints the final happiness score.

### ✅ Optional Optimization Tip:

If the array is very large and you want to optimize using frequency counts (to avoid scanning each item), you could use `collections.Counter`. Let me know if you'd like that version too.

Do you want this turned into a function or class structure for reuse in larger projects or competitive programming?
