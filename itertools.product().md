Certainly, I'll provide the problem statement first, then the code explanation step-by-step, followed by an overall detailed explanation.

### **Problem Statement**
You are given two lists, **A** and **B**, with no duplicate integer elements in each list. Your task is to compute their Cartesian product and display the result in the desired format.

#### **What is a Cartesian Product?**
The Cartesian product of two sets (or lists) **A** and **B** is the set of all ordered pairs \((a, b)\), where \(a\) is an element of **A** and \(b\) is an element of **B**. For example:
- If \(A = [1, 2]\) and \(B = [3, 4]\),
  \[
  A \times B = [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
  \]

#### **Input Format**
- The first line contains the space-separated elements of list \(A\).
- The second line contains the space-separated elements of list \(B\).

#### **Output Format**
- The output should be the Cartesian product of \(A\) and \(B\), formatted as a space-separated string of tuples (e.g., `(1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4)`).

### **Python Code**

```python
from itertools import product

# Input two lists
A = list(map(int, input("Enter elements of list A separated by spaces: ").split()))
B = list(map(int, input("Enter elements of list B separated by spaces: ").split()))

# Compute Cartesian product
cartesian_product = product(A, B)

# Display the result in the desired format
print(" ".join(map(str, cartesian_product)))
```

### **Code Explanation**

1. **Importing the `product` function**:
   ```python
   from itertools import product
   ```
   - The `itertools.product` function is used to compute the Cartesian product of input iterables.
   - It eliminates the need for writing nested loops to generate all pair combinations.

2. **Taking Input for Lists \(A\) and \(B\)**:
   ```python
   A = list(map(int, input("Enter elements of list A separated by spaces: ").split()))
   B = list(map(int, input("Enter elements of list B separated by spaces: ").split()))
   ```
   - `input()` takes the input as a string.
   - `split()` splits the string into a list of strings based on spaces.
   - `map(int, ...)` converts each string element of the list to an integer.
   - `list()` ensures the resulting elements are stored in a list.

   Example input:
   - For \(A\): If you type `1 2`, it will be converted into `A = [1, 2]`.
   - For \(B\): If you type `3 4`, it will be converted into `B = [3, 4]`.

3. **Computing the Cartesian Product**:
   ```python
   cartesian_product = product(A, B)
   ```
   - `product(A, B)` generates all possible ordered pairs \((a, b)\), where \(a\) is from \(A\) and \(b\) is from \(B\).
   - This returns an iterator of tuples, e.g., `[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]`.

4. **Formatting the Output**:
   ```python
   print(" ".join(map(str, cartesian_product)))
   ```
   - `map(str, cartesian_product)` converts each tuple in the Cartesian product iterator into a string.
   - `" ".join(...)` joins these string-formatted tuples with spaces in between to create the desired output format.

   Output example:
   For \(A = [1, 2]\) and \(B = [3, 4]\), the output will be:
   ```
   (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4)
   ```

### **Detailed Walkthrough of the Code**

1. **User Input**:
   You are prompted to input space-separated integers for lists \(A\) and \(B\). Example:
   ```
   Enter elements of list A separated by spaces: 1 2
   Enter elements of list B separated by spaces: 3 4
   ```

2. **Cartesian Product Computation**:
   The function `product(A, B)` works as if it were using nested loops:
   ```python
   [(x, y) for x in A for y in B]
   ```
   For \(A = [1, 2]\) and \(B = [3, 4]\), this produces:
   ```
   [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
   ```

3. **Formatting and Printing**:
   After converting the tuples to strings, they are concatenated with spaces into a single string:
   ```
   (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4)
   ```
