# **Problem Statement**
You are given a string `S` (containing only uppercase English letters) and an integer `k`. Your task is to print all possible combinations of the characters in `S`, of size `1` up to `k`, in lexicographically sorted order. 

For example:
- Input: `"HACK 2"`
- Output:  
  ```
  A
  C
  H
  K
  AC
  AH
  AK
  CH
  CK
  HK
  ```

# **Code Explanation**

#### **1. Importing `itertools.combinations`**
We use the `combinations` function from Python's `itertools` module. This function generates all possible combinations of a specified length `r` from the given iterable (like a string or list).

#### **2. Input Handling**
```python
input_line = input()
S, k = input_line.split()
k = int(k)
```
- The program takes input in the format: `<String> <Integer>` (e.g., `"HACK 2"`).
- The string `S` is separated from the integer `k` using `.split()`.
- `k` is converted to an integer since input from the user is treated as a string by default.

#### **3. Sorting the String**
```python
for r in range(1, k + 1):
```
- The string `S` is **implicitly sorted** when passed to the `combinations` function. This ensures that combinations are produced in lexicographic order. 

#### **4. Generating Combinations**
```python
for combo in combinations(sorted(S), r):
    print(''.join(combo))
```
- The loop iterates over sizes from `1` to `k` (inclusive), represented by `r`.
- For each value of `r`, the `combinations` function generates all `r`-length combinations of the sorted string. For example:
  - For `S = "HACK"` and `r = 2`, it generates:
    ```
    ('A', 'C'), ('A', 'H'), ('A', 'K'), ('C', 'H'), ('C', 'K'), ('H', 'K')
    ```
- Each combination (a tuple) is converted into a string using `''.join(combo)` and printed on a new line.

# **Key Features of the Code**
1. **Itertools Efficiency**: The `combinations` function ensures that duplicate combinations are avoided and lexicographic order is maintained without extra effort.
2. **Dynamic Output**: The code adapts to any valid string and integer input, creating combinations for varying sizes up to `k`.
3. **Sorting**: Sorting the string ensures the desired lexicographic order is automatically achieved.

### **Sample Input and Output**

#### Input:
```
HACK 2
```

#### Execution Steps:
1. The string `S = "HACK"` is sorted to `"A", "C", "H", "K"`.
2. For `r = 1` (single characters):
   ```
   A
   C
   H
   K
   ```
3. For `r = 2` (pairs of characters):
   ```
   AC
   AH
   AK
   CH
   CK
   HK
   ```

#### Output:
```
A
C
H
K
AC
AH
AK
CH
CK
HK
```

This code handles various scenarios efficiently and produces combinations based on the input constraints.
