# **Problem Statement**
You are tasked with generating a logo for "HackerRank" using the character `H`. The logo should be of variable thickness, based on user input. The generated logo consists of five parts:
1. **Top cone**: A cone shape formed using the `H` character.
2. **Top pillars**: Two vertical pillars of `H` characters side by side.
3. **Middle belt**: A horizontal belt of `H` characters.
4. **Bottom pillars**: Similar to the top pillars.
5. **Bottom cone**: An inverted cone shape formed using the `H` character.

To achieve the desired alignment for these parts, you need to use Python's string methods: `.ljust()`, `.rjust()`, and `.center()`.

---

## **Proper Explanation**
- **Input**: A single integer, `thickness`, which determines the size of the logo.
- **Output**: The logo with a height and width proportional to the input thickness.

The code works by generating different parts of the logo using loops and string alignment methods:
1. **`.ljust(width, fillchar)`**: Left-aligns the text in a string of specified width.
2. **`.rjust(width, fillchar)`**: Right-aligns the text in a string of specified width.
3. **`.center(width, fillchar)`**: Centers the text in a string of specified width.

### **Python Code with Explanation**

```python
# Input: Thickness of the logo
thickness = int(input("Enter the thickness value: ")) 
c = 'H'  # The character used to form the logo

# 1. Top Cone
for i in range(thickness):
    # Print left-aligned Hs, single center H, and right-aligned Hs
    print((c * i).rjust(thickness - 1) + c + (c * i).ljust(thickness - 1))

# 2. Top Pillars
for i in range(thickness + 1):
    # Two centered blocks of Hs with space between them
    print((c * thickness).center(thickness * 2) + (c * thickness).center(thickness * 6))

# 3. Middle Belt
for i in range((thickness + 1) // 2):
    # A single large centered block of Hs
    print((c * thickness * 5).center(thickness * 6))

# 4. Bottom Pillars
for i in range(thickness + 1):
    # Two centered blocks of Hs with space between them
    print((c * thickness).center(thickness * 2) + (c * thickness).center(thickness * 6))

# 5. Bottom Cone
for i in range(thickness):
    # Print right-aligned Hs, single center H, and left-aligned Hs
    print(((c * (thickness - i - 1)).rjust(thickness) + c + 
           (c * (thickness - i - 1)).ljust(thickness)).rjust(thickness * 6))
```

### **Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code**

1. **Input Thickness**:
   - The `thickness` variable determines the size of the logo. A larger thickness results in a bigger logo.

2. **Top Cone**:
   - A loop iterates `thickness` times to print the upper cone.
   - For each iteration, `rjust` and `ljust` are used to align the `H` characters symmetrically around a central `H`.

3. **Top Pillars**:
   - Another loop iterates `thickness + 1` times.
   - `center` aligns two vertical blocks of `H` with some space between them.

4. **Middle Belt**:
   - A small loop iterates `(thickness + 1) // 2` times.
   - A wide horizontal block of `H` is centered using `center`.

5. **Bottom Pillars**:
   - Similar to the top pillars, two vertical blocks of `H` are printed side by side.

6. **Bottom Cone**:
   - A loop iterates `thickness` times to print the inverted cone.
   - For each iteration, `rjust` and `ljust` are used to align the `H` characters symmetrically around a central `H`, but in reverse order.
